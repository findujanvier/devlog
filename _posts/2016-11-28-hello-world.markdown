 Hi folks, 
 My name is Jan, I am a self-learning game developer. I love making game since I was a little kid. Okay! this is enough introduction :D. 
I create this blog for several purposes. A place to share my game development experience, and improving my writing skill in English. 
Yeah, this is not my native language, so don't expect too much :p. Finally is where I can somehow someway marketing my skill to the world.
Every talented needs food and shelter right! For more detail, I mostly working on Unity Engine, and I have worked in some 2d projects, 
but I am not into this subject for now. The main reason is the company I am working currently, which is an AR startup. So I spent most 
of my time right now to working with 3d games. I love to exchange knowledge about game architect, gameplay, and game design also. So if you want to
have a person to talk with, call me ;).
